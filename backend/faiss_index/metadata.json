Portion of DLF\u2019s real estate portfolio is located in regions that fall under water stressed areas. Thus, efficient water management through conservation and reuse is prime focus for DLF to ensure its business sustainability, optimize operational costs as well promote sustainable communities around DLF properties and townships. **Mitigation Measures:** - DLF applies the 4R (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse & Replenish) strategy to ensure water use efficiency and water conservation; - Water recycling measures have been implemented across all properties to reduce freshwater drawal. Rainwater harvesting is practiced in all managed properties to recharge groundwater; Content - All rental and residential projects are designed for zero liquid discharge. On-site wastewater treatment plants have been installed in managed assets, which have helped reduce freshwater drawal by approximately 40% over the last few years. Treated wastewater is used for horticulture, toilet flushing and in cooling towers for Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) and Diesel Generator (DG) sets. Furthermore, dual pipe plumbing systems in buildings enable the use of recycled or treated water for flushing; - Other measures include installation of high efficiency fixtures, sensor based low-flow water taps and leak detection systems in washrooms and drip irrigation in gardens, which has helped promote water conservation; and - DLF\u2019s Rental business, achieved \u2018LEED Zero Water\u2019 Certification for properties including DLF Cybercity, Gurugram and DLF Cybercity, Chennai, from the USGBC, by achieving a potable water use balance of zero.

As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities.

All of DLF\u2019s rental properties and certain clubs (hospitality portfolio) have implemented the mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge. Zero-discharge Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) have been installed across all the rental portfolio. Treated water and storm water are utilized for irrigation of landscape, gardening, sanitation and as make-up water used in cooling towers for HVAC and DG sets. Additionally, dual pipe plumbing system is installed in buildings, which helps in using recycled treated water for flushing purpose. The sludge generated from STPs is reused as manure for horticulture. To improve the efficiency of STP, high-efficiency volute systems have been installed in place of traditional sludge dewatering systems such as filter press and centrifuge. Additionally, retrieval air grid system has been adapted at maximum sites due to which sewage breakdown and timely maintenance of diffusers is ensured. DLF\u2019s Rental business achieved \u2018 **LEED Zero Water** \u2019 certification for properties including DLF Cybercity, Gurugram and DLF Cybercity, Chennai, from the USGBC, by achieving a potable water use balance of zero. Five of DLF\u2019s Malls have also obtained this certification. DLF is India\u2019s first real estate organisation to achieve LEED Zero Water Certification.

DLF is committed to waste minimisation and promoting efficient use of resources throughout the lifecycle of construction and portfolio management. It undertakes several measures to reduce, reuse or recycle waste generated from the business activities. - Project-specific plans are put in place for efficient resource use and waste recycling, prior to initiating construction. DLF also work with customers and waste disposal companies to introduce recycling systems into leases for rental buildings; - Contractors engaged in construction are encouraged to recover, reuse and recycle building materials; - The Company educates its employees, tenants and contractors on appropriate waste management techniques and support contractors to promote waste management awareness at its development sites, as required; and - All waste generated from business activities across all operations is recycled, reused, composted, treated for energy recovery, or sent to authorized recyclers for suitable handling. Waste Collection, Segregation and Management - It is a constant effort to ensure all generated waste is suitably treated and no waste is sent to landfill at all its sites. Construction waste generated during concreting and plastering process is collected, segregated and reused in filling underneath the stich slab. Steel scrap is used in non-structural members of the building to reduce waste. In addition, to divert 36 waste from landfills, DLF tries to source or sell to recycling facilities. For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy. - DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below: a. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping. b. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste. This dry waste is further directed for reuse, recycling through authorised vendors or sent to waste-to-energy plants. c. Black Bin: Hazardous waste items such as sanitary waste and e-waste. The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements.",
